The Electron.exe file is not included in the repository due to its large size. However, all necessary files can be found in the release section. The only modification made to the Electron executable was an edit to the EXE icon using Resource Hacker.

The main.js file has been updated to prompt the user for the Romm instance URL upon initial launch. This URL is then saved for future launches and can be found in /resources/app/settings.json.
